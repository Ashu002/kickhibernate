OnetoOne relation is One Entity is associated with  only one Entity

In this relationship, one object of the one Entity class contains association with one object of the another Entity class.

To apply one to one relationship between two entity class objects it is possible by without taking a separate foreign key column in the child table of the database

There are two ways to perform one to one mapping in hibernate:

    By many-to-one element
    By one-to-one element
